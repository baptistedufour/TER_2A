* Compilation/installation
** Prerequisite
- A fortran compiler
- The gnu make utility
- The UMFPACK library, which is part of the SuiteSparse package. You can find it
  on T. Davis web page: [[http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html][http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html]]
** Compilation
To compile, simply run 'make'. 

You can run 'make clean' to delete the local object files. The compiled exec files
and will remain. Type 'make distclean' to remove everything.
